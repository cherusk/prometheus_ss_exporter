# Prometheus Socket Statistics Exporter Configuration - Complete Reference
# Shows minimal settings for ALL available configuration options aligned with Nim config types

logic:
  # Complete metrics collection configuration
  metrics:
    # Histogram metrics for latency distributions
    histograms:
      active: false                    # Enable/disable histogram collection globally
      bucketBounds: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 50.0, 100.0, 200.0]  # Latency bucket boundaries in ms
    
    # Gauge metrics for real-time TCP values
    gauges:
      active: false                    # Enable/disable gauge collection globally
      rtt:                           # TCP round-trip time gauge
        active: false                 # Enable RTT gauge metric
      cwnd:                          # TCP congestion window gauge
        active: false                 # Enable congestion window gauge metric
      deliveryRate:                  # TCP delivery rate gauge
        active: false                 # Enable delivery rate gauge metric
    
    # Counter metrics for cumulative data segment counts
    counters:
      active: false                   # Enable/disable counter collection globally
      dataSegsIn:                    # Incoming data segments counter
        active: false                 # Enable incoming data segments counter
      dataSegsOut:                   # Outgoing data segments counter
        active: false                 # Enable outgoing data segments counter
  
  # Label compression to reduce metric cardinality
  compression:
    labelFolding: "raw_endpoint"      # "raw_endpoint" or "pid_condensed"
  
  # Complete flow filtering configuration (all filters are optional)
  selection:
    # Process filtering - filter flows by process ID or command name
    process:
      pids: []                       # List of process IDs to monitor (empty = no PID filtering)
      cmds: []                       # List of command names to monitor (empty = no command filtering)
    
    # Network/peer filtering - filter flows by network endpoints
    peering:
      addresses: []                  # Specific IP addresses to monitor (empty = no address filtering)
      networks: []                   # CIDR networks to monitor (empty = no network filtering)
      hosts: []                      # Hostnames to monitor (empty = no hostname filtering)
    
    # Port range filtering - filter flows by destination port ranges
    portRanges: []                   # List of port ranges (empty = no port range filtering)
    # Port range examples:
    # - lower: 80                   # HTTP traffic
    #   upper: 443                  # HTTPS traffic
    # - lower: 8000                 # Custom app port range
    #   upper: 9000
